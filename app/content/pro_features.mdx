In addition to the basic features, we offer a variety of configurable options for professional individual users and business users to meet different scenarios and needs. Here is an introduction to the advanced features of this plugin:

## 7.1 Define AI Identity/Role
Our plugin allows you to customize the identity or role your AI plays in chats, or the rules you want it to follow, by using predefined prompts. By setting a unique prompt for your AI, you can better integrate it into your chat environment.

Open the plugin settings page.
In the "AI Identity/Role" setting, enter the unique prompt you've created for your AI.
Save the settings.
## 7.2 One-Click Bot Takeover
With the one-click bot takeover feature, you can easily let AI take over your chats and provide intelligent responses and assistance to your friends.

Turning on Bot Takeover means your WeChat account agrees to accept the information returned by ChatGPT, effectively becoming a bot.
Turning off Bot Takeover means your WeChat account will no longer accept information from ChatGPT.
## 7.3 Welcome Message for New Group Members
When new members join a group chat, the AI can automatically send a welcome message to help them integrate better into the group.

```
Welcome to this group! 
I'm **, your AI assistant in WhatsApp. 
How can I help you today? ðŸ˜Š
```
## 7.4 Customize Single User Question Frequency
To prevent users from asking the AI questions too frequently, you can set custom frequency limits for each user.

- Single user question frequency: 5 times per 10 minutes
- Single user question frequency: 10 times per 10 minutes
- Single user question frequency: 15 times per 10 minutes
- Single user question frequency: No limit
> The default question frequency for the basic version is 10 chances to ask questions every 10 minutes.
## 7.5 Customize Queue Backlog Alert Threshold
To ensure that the AI's processing capacity is not overloaded, you can set a queue backlog alert threshold. When the number of messages waiting to be processed exceeds the threshold, the system will automatically trigger an alert.

- Queue backlog: 5 messages trigger an alert
- Queue backlog: 10 messages trigger an alert
- Queue backlog: 15 messages trigger an alert
- No alerts
