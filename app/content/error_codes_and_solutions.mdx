## 9.1 ChatGPT Errors
### 9.1.1 CLOUDFLARE
Error reasons:

- DNS configuration error: To make Cloudflare services work properly, you need to set up DNS records correctly. If your DNS settings are incorrect, you might see an error message.

- Server connection issues: If your server has connection issues, it may affect your ability to connect to Cloudflare services.
- Service interruptions: In rare cases, Cloudflare may experience service interruptions, which can cause users to be unable to access their services.
> Our suggestion: When a CLOUDFLARE error occurs, change or disable the proxy, refresh the chatgpt, and try again. If it still doesn't work, choose to use the API.
