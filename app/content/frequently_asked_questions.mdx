## 8.5 Why did I receive the message "Sorry, ChatGPT service exception"?
The following circumstances may lead to the above error message:

Due to the Cloudflare protection added by ChatGPT, the ChatGPT page needs to be refreshed every 2 hours. If the user receives the above error message after asking a question, it means that the https://chat.openai.com/chat page needs to be refreshed or re-logged in.
Due to the concurrent limit of ChatGPT, only one message can be sent at a time. Please wait for other questions to complete the response before sending another message, or wait for a minute.
Due to the service exception of ChatGPT itself, causing request errors or network errors, etc.
Due to network reasons, such as using VPN, accelerator, etc. that often causes Cloudflare errors, need to be resolved by oneself.

## 8.6 Input API-Key but there is no response!
Click on the plugin and check the validity of your API.
Check if the API-Key has expired.
If the API-Key is valid, please make sure that the network can access openai normally, refresh the WeChat page, and try again.

## 8.7 Why @ the robot but there is no response?
Please find the icon of this plugin in the Chrome browser navigation bar, click the icon, and see if the ChatGPT page in the pop-up is logged in. If it is not logged in, try clicking the plugin icon multiple times.
The plugin has restrictions on the number of characters in questions, and the question content (excluding the @ nickname) must exceed 2 characters to trigger a ChatGPT response.
Check if there are emoticons or other special characters in your WeChat nickname. If so, please modify it to a simple nickname, it is recommended to only use numbers, letters, or Chinese characters, and refresh the WeChat web page after modification.
## 8.8 Why does it take so long to receive the @ robot message and feel slow to respond?
Because the ChatGPT response is an asynchronous data stream, on the web page, you can refresh the data stream response in real-time, but in WeChat messages, you can only wait until the complete result is received and sent once, so the experience feels like a delay of about 30 seconds, depending on how much ChatGPT responds, this is a normal phenomenon.

We hope the above answers can help you resolve any issues you may encounter while using the ChatGPT For WhatsApp service. If you have any other questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact us at contact@aoq.me.
